# Learning-Git

## Overview

Welcome to the **Learning-Git** repository! This project was created as part of a live demonstration on how to use Git, presented to my classmates during my bachelor's degree. The demonstration was part of an internship at **UNICA**, an organization within **UNAM** that supports students in enhancing their skills in software development, networking, and cybersecurity.
